# Welcome to Flavor Town!
A site for the recipes I'd like to cook...eventually @-@

This is a demonstration of my learning on how to create a simple site with HTML. Was intent on only using HTML, but I went a little overboard and added CSS and a few more assets (relative to my current exp.) to the site to make it a bit nicer.

Check out the site: https://dmnuggins.github.io/odin-recipes/
